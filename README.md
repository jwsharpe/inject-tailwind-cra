## Inject Tailwind Create-React-App v0.1
Dangerously injects TailwindCSS to a fresh create-react-app project. Currently there are no checks in place to stop it from just injecting where it feels like. Do be careful!

## How to run
Create a react app
```npx create-react-app your-project && cd your-project```
Next run this script.
```npx inject-tailwind-cra```
Then get to work.
